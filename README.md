# Code-Noir
This project I'm working in will be an interactive story set in the 1930s. 
I am brand new to coding, so this project will be very simple 
(I pretty much only know how to make text appear and how to use variables and conditions, so don't expect a whole lot lol). 
I don't have a dead line that I want to finish this thing by.
I'll basically just be working on this when I have free time. 
Here, I'll be uploading scenes that may or may not make it into the final product.
